          <div class="info-paragraph-sub-title col-xs-12">MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</div>
          <div class="info-paragraph-par">
            <div class="info-paragraph-sub-info col-xs-12">
              PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. BY ELECTING ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD IN COURT AND WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING CLASS CLAIMS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.<br>Arbitration is a method of resolving a claim, dispute or controversy without filing a lawsuit. By agreeing to arbitrate, the right to go to court is waived and instead claims, disputes or controversies are submitted to binding arbitration. This provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement. You and SNT Media agree that use of this website and your subscription affect interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies.<br>By using this website, you elect to have disputes resolved by arbitration. You and SNT Media may pursue a Claim. Claim means any dispute between you and SNT Media relating to your use of this website, subscription, or our relationship, including any application, subscription, and any representations, omissions or warranties. You or SNT Media may seek remedies in small claims court without arbitrating to the extent your Claim is subject to the jurisdiction of a small claims court. In addition, either party may bring an action in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (intellectual property rights means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).<br>Except as specifically provided herein, all Claims must be resolved by arbitration. You or SNT Media may select arbitration with American Arbitration Association or JAMS, except the arbitrator shall have no authority to find that a Claim is subject to arbitration on a class basis or as part of another representative action. The hearing will be in the federal district where you reside. For residents outside of the United States, arbitration must be initiated in the State of Illinois, United States of America, and you and SNT Media agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Cook County, Illinois, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. If agreed, arbitration may be by telephone or written submissions. Filing and arbitrator fees are to be paid per the sponsor rules. You may contact the sponsor for a fee waiver. If no fee waiver applies, SNT Media will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not seek more than $75,000. Each party is responsible for other fees. The arbitrator may award costs or fees to the prevailing party, if permitted by law. SNT Media will not seek fees, unless the claims are frivolous.<br>The arbitrator shall be an attorney or current or retired judge. The arbitrator shall follow substantive law, statute of limitations and decide all issues relating to the interpretation, construction, enforceability and applicability of this provision. The arbitrator may order relief permitted by law. This provision is governed and enforceable pursuant to the FAA. An award shall include a written opinion and be final, subject to appeal pursuant to the FAA, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>This provision survives termination of your subscription, our relationship, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If part of this provision is unenforceable, the remainder remains in effect. AS SET FORTH ABOVE, YOU AND SNT MEDIA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If unenforceability allows arbitration as a class action, then this mandatory arbitration provision is entirely unenforceable.<br>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by this mandatory arbitration provision by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to support@sntmedia.com with the subject line, Mandatory Arbitration Opt-Out. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the (a) Effective Date of these Terms; or (b) the first date that you agreed to any version of these Terms that contains this version of the mandatory arbitration provision, whichever is earlier. If you opt out of the mandatory arbitration provision, SNT Media also will not be bound by it in its disputes with you.<br>SNT Media reserves the right to make changes to this mandatory arbitration provision after providing written notice. Changes will become effective on the sixtieth (60th) day after notice, and will apply prospectively only to claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this section allowing changes is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the mandatory arbitration provision, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first mandatory arbitration provision you agreed to.
